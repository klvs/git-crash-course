# Git crash course
Interactive git tutorial. Let's go!

Git is a powerful piece of version control software. It helps you maintain a history of your work, revert changes, collaborate remotely with teammates and much much more. Most professional software engineers use git on the daily (I do!). It can be intimidating at first but is VERY rewarding once you get the hang of it. Lucky for you, you've got a professional programmer here willing to teach you and help you out if you get stuck (that's me!) 

If you're looking to go into software as a career, you're definitely going to end up learning git at one point or another. Why not now? If you're not then, well, you can impress your techie friends with your git-fu.

## Set up

Okay, so you'll need a couple things to get started:
* [A github account](https://github.com/join) 
  * So you can use github...
* [git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) 
  * this is a git GUI (graphic user interface). I personally do not use git kraken very much because I prefer a command line interface. CLI is the way to go and a lot of programmers use it instead. Even if you feel like taking on the challenge, I reccomend using git kraken to start with. 
  * You'll need to make an account with gitkraken to use it for some reason... If you can sign up/in with your github account.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) 
  * If you're on a mac or linux box you probably already have git installed. If you're on windows (boo! :poop:) you'll need to install it.
* [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (optional)
  * You can just use greenfoot editor but it's honestly really terrible. You can checkout camille's vs code setup, it's honestly so so much better. You can however get by without it.
  
 ## Once all the software is installed
 
* Boot up Git Kraken and clone the repository.
  * On the [repo's home page](https://github.com/klvs/git-crash-course), look for the green button "clone or download", click it and copy the URL.
  * In GK, click the folder icon in the top left and click clone. Paste the URL you just copied, click the clone repo button and let's get Kraken.
  
Email me with your github username so I can add you to the repo and give you write access. You can email me at work during the week at **alexander.roman {at} sony.com**  or **aeroman {at} ucsc.edu during the weekend**. Emails will reach me very quickly at my work email during weekday work hours (10am - 7pm) but I don't check it regularly otherwise. You also get camille to bug me.

## Once you've been added
* You'll get an email notification from github
* If you can figure out how to:
  * make your own branch
  * make a change that adds your name to the section below
  * commit it
  * and open a Pull Request (from your branch into master)
I will be very impressed and double points to you! **However, when we find time to go over get on a call / slack chat I'll go over all of this.**

## Disclaimer
I love teaching people, but you should make sure that it's okay with your proffessor that I'm helping you. I can't imagine he would mind but to be clear I won't be writing any code for you. I can help you folks in the form of teaching you git, answering questions and reviewing your code (time and work permiting). **Nonetheless, please clear this with your professor!** Better safe than sorry. You can say this: 

_"Hey <whatever his name is>, Alex is an engineer at PlayStation who's down to help us out, answer questions and teach us a thing or two to make collaborating easier. He's going to teach us to use git, github and possibly review code, but beyond that, he won't be writing any code or offering any unfair advantage. Is this out of line with the course's academic honesty policy? We don't think it is but want to make sure it's okay."_ :blush:
  
I love helping out but my time during the work week is limited. I'll do my best to respond but you may need to fall back on google or making due. I'll help sort things out in git-land if you need to stray from it. This will be some extra work at first and git does have a bit of a learning curve but I promise it will pay off. 

## We'll add your names and title here
Make your title sound cool.
